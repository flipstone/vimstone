# Contributing to Vimstone Tutor

If you followed the standard installation, the Vimstone tutor files live in
~/.config/nvim/tutor.

To be able to edit and save them you will need to enable tutor debugging:

~~~ cmd
:let g:tutor_debug=1
~~~

Once you're done, you can set set the value back to 0.

The tutorial format is a modified version of markdown. For more info, see
the [tutor tutor](@tutor:tutor).
